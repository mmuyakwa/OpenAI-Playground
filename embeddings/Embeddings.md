# Embeddings Documentation

This document explains the code found in `embeddings.py` which is an example of how to use the embeddings API provided by OpenAI.

## Overview

The script uses the OpenAI Python client to create an embedding from a given text prompt. Embeddings are numerical representations of text that can be used for various natural language processing tasks.

## Code Explanation

1. **Import Statements:**
   The script imports the `OpenAI` class from the `openai` library.

2. **OpenAI Client Initialization:**
   An instance of the `OpenAI` client is created.

3. **Creating an Embedding:**
   The `embeddings.create` method is called on the client instance, passing in the model name (`text-embedding-ada-002`) and the input text prompt.

4. **Output:**
   The response, which contains the embedding, is printed to the console.

## Example Usage

The script can be used to generate embeddings for text prompts, which can then be used for tasks such as semantic search, clustering, or similarity comparison.
